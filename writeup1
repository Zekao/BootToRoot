### First Writeup

-   We will use nikto to see the different ports available on the machine ( It's a tool to examine a web server to find potential problems and security vulnerabilities, including)
    We can see that there is potentially some interresting informations in forum folder
    ```md
        + OSVDB-3092: /forum/: This might be interesting...
    ```
    When we access to https://192.168.56.101/forum/ we can see that we have different users:
    - lmezard
    - zaz
    - wandre
    - qudevide
    - thor
-   We can see that there is also something interresting with SquirrelMail
    ```md
        + OSVDB-3093: /webmail/src/read_body.php: SquirrelMail found
    ```
- While looking at the forum, we can see that lmezard made a post with error connection logs, at a certain moment, we can see a password in the logs
    ```md
    Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
    ```

-   It will be the password for loggin as lmezard on the forum
-   On the settings, we can find a mail address that we can use to connect to the webmail service

> laurie@borntosec.net
> !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

    -   As we can see, there is a mail with the phpmyadmin password

- Now we will do an SQL injection in order to access to the machine as a shell
  - After that, while navigating through files and directories, I've found a password and login on /home/LOOKATME/password
  We can't use it to log in ssh, but we can use it to access ftp, it will give us some logfiles containing an hidden password, it's Iheartpwnage, we have to convert it to SHA-256 in order to access to the machine on ssh


- When we accessed on ssh on laurie@192.168.56.101, we can see an executable called bomb, a sort of minigame with 6 steps
